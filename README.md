# Mario-Party-Scorekeeper

I have played Mario Party since I was a kid and I thought what better way to learn full-stack development and React than with a scorekeeper! 

The Mario Party Score Keeper is a MERN stack web app that allows the user to track games played and player scores for the first 7 Mario Party games. 
The user is able to view games played, add new games, and delete games.

This project is a work-in-progress and a learning experience for me in the MERN stack of development. 

Below are some short gifs that showcase the current functionality of the application:

Simple Input Validation: 

* In the event that two players collect the same numbers of stars and coins, in Mario Party games 1 - 7 the tie is determined by a dice roll and beyond the scope of this             application
