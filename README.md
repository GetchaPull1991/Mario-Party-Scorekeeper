# Mario Party Score Keeper

The Mario Party Score Keeper is a MERN(MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack application that allows the user to track scores for seven different Mario Party Games. 
These games include 1-3 Nintendo 64 releases and 4-7 Gamecube releases. 

The interface will allow users to select the game board played, input the player name, character name, number of stars and number of coins for 4 players. The server API will determine the place of the player based on the greatest number of stars, or the greates number of coins if two star values are the same. 

The user can navigate between the games using the navigation bar at the top of the screen and a set of image links at the bottom of the home page
