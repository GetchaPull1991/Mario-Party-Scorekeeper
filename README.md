# Mario-Party-Scorekeeper

I have played Mario Party since I was a kid and I thought what better way to learn full-stack development and React than with a scorekeeper! 

The Mario Party Score Keeper is a MERN stack web app that allows the user to track games played and player scores for the first 7 Mario Party games. 
The user is able to view games played, add new games, and delete games.

This project is a work-in-progress and a learning experience for me in the MERN stack of development. 

### Features yet to be implemented: 
- Edit Games
- Determine what the player placed on the server-side (1st place goes to the player with the greatest number of stars. If two players have equal stars the greatest number of coins will get 1st place)
- An additional page to show games based on different criteria (includuing a certain player, games with a certain range of stars or coins)

Below are some short gifs that showcase the current functionality of the application:
